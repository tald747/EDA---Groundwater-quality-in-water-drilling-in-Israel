### EDA project (python) on the quality of groundwater drillings in Israel
* The main database file along with two additional supplementary files, were downloaded from the government database at: https://data.gov.il/dataset
* The database hold records for the last 9 years (2012-2020).
* I made use of two visualizations libraries in this project: seaborn and  plotly (express and cufflinks).
* One should download all files from the repository and open 'water drills.ipynb' file in Collab (or any other supported IDE).
